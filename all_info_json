    "experience_description": "The Nevada State Railroad Museum, located in Carson City, Nevada, preserves the railroad heritage of Nevada, including locomotives and cars of the famous Virginia and Truckee Railroad.  Much of the museum equipment was obtained from various Hollywood studios, where they were used in movies and television.  The museum is operated by the Nevada Department of Tourism and Cultural Affairs.   Opened in 1980, it was originally named the Virginia & Truckee Railroad Museum, often shortened to V&T Railroad Museum, but was renamed the Nevada State Railroad Museum in 1985.[1]",
